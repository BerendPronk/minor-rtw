# Experimenting with sockets
I never tried to create something using sockets myself, yet. It sure is a very nice technology, so I was glad to see that this topic was featured in the minor. For this specific task, of experimenting with sockets, I was given a week time in total.

### Project to-do's
- [x] Initialize project
- [x] Readme
- [x] Choosing a code-style
- [x] Set-up Epxress
- [ ] Set-up Socket.io
- [ ] Deploy application

#### Extra's
- [ ] Node Hero (complete chapters 1-4)
- [ ] DIY / Reinvent the wheel, get the application to work without express, request and socket.io

## Initializing project
As I learned from the other courses of the minor, I initialized this project using `npm init`, and used GitHub to clone this repository to my computer, as well. It's nice to consider doing this for each projecet, whatever the size may be, so I really grind it into my memory.

## Adding README.md
The README you're currently reading was added after the initialization of the project, and functions as a living document this week of experimenting with sockets specifically. Whenever something is added to, or updated from the project, it'll be documented here.

## Choosing a code-style
This project will be my start of using the ES2016 JavaScript-syntax. I've used some ES2016 features before, but always left out constants, arrow-functions and template literals. With the use of the [`ESLint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)-linter, my code will be checked on the ES2016-syntax and genral syntax-errors.

I tried to set up the [`xo`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)-linter first, but wasn't satisfied with process of configuring it to my preferences. `ESLint` provided me with a solution that was to my liking, configuring it via the command line interface.

## Setting up Express
I've used Node.js a couple of times in the past, and always combined it with the `Express` framework to handle the routing and serving of static files. Setting everything up was know territory for me. The only thing that I needed to get used to, was using the ES2016-notation, but I'll get there with some practice!
